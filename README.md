## üîê Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Logout Redirect Security Bug  
**File**: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  

#### Problem  
Users who logged out from protected routes (like `/submit` or `/my-quotes`) were being redirected back to those same protected pages, causing immediate authentication errors or infinite loops.

#### Root Cause  
After logout, the application redirected the user to the previous page instead of a public route, despite the session being cleared.

#### Fix  
Updated the `signOut` function to redirect users explicitly to the homepage:
```ts
await supabase.auth.signOut();
window.location.href = '/';
```

#### Impact  
- ‚úÖ Smooth logout flow  
- ‚úÖ Prevented accidental access to protected content after logout  
- ‚úÖ Improved user experience and session handling  

---

### 2. Protected Route Access Control  
**File**: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented  

#### Problem  
Unauthenticated users could access protected pages if they directly navigated to URLs before the auth check completed.

#### Fix  
Created a dedicated `ProtectedRoute` wrapper component:
- Displays a loading spinner while verifying authentication
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth` login page

#### Integration  
Used for all protected routes:  
```tsx
<Route path="/submit" element={<ProtectedRoute><SubmitPage /></ProtectedRoute>} />
```

#### Impact  
- ‚úÖ Enforced access control  
- ‚úÖ Reduced potential for unauthorized access  
- ‚úÖ Smoother UX during auth state checks  

---

### 3. Security Enhancements (Edge Functions & Input Handling)  
**Files**: `supabase/functions/submit-quote.ts`, `update-quote.ts`, `src/utils/sanitize.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  

#### Fixes Applied:
- **Rate Limiting**:  
  - 10 requests per minute per user  
  - Returns 429 error for excessive requests  
  ```ts
  if (requestLimitExceeded(user.id)) {
    return new Response('Too many requests', { status: 429 });
  }
  ```

- **Input Sanitization**:  
  - Created `sanitize.ts` utility to encode HTML entities  
  - Prevents XSS vulnerabilities in quotes and authors  
  ```ts
  import { encode } from 'html-entities';
  const sanitizedQuote = encode(userInput.quote);
  ```

#### Impact  
- ‚úÖ Reduced attack surface  
- ‚úÖ Protected against XSS  
- ‚úÖ Enforced safe usage of Edge Functions

## üé® UI Enhancements

### 4. Responsive Footer Component  
**File**: `src/components/Footer.tsx`  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Added  

#### Problem  
The app lacked a consistent footer across pages, affecting brand presence and usability.

#### Fix  
Implemented a responsive, mobile-first footer:
- 3-column layout: About, Quick Links, Social Media
- Sticky footer on short content pages
- Vertical stacking on mobile

#### Impact  
- ‚úÖ Improved UI/UX consistency  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced branding and navigation
